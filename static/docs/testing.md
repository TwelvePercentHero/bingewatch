# Testing

Details of testing for the **Binge | Watch** app built as part of the **Data Centric Development Milestone Project** can be found below.

## Validation

**W3C Markup Validation** was used to validate HTML.

**W3C CSS Validation** was used to validate CSS.

**JSHint** was used to validate jQuery.

**Python extension for Visual Studio Code** was used to validate Python.

## Automated Testing

I developed a series of automated tests for my Python code which can be found in the **testing** folder.

However, these automated tests were created after the app was developed rather than before, as my understanding of Python code, how it works and how it should work is still developing. As such I did not feel confident building tests before starting development and understanding whether or not they were successful.

For future projects I intend to engage fully in a test-first development process as my knowledge of Python and its functionality is far greater having completed this project.

I also created a separate set of test files used to troubleshoot image uploads when I was experiencing problems with this functionality, these are also included in the **testing** folder.

## Manual Testing

I also created a series of user tests based on the **User Stories** found in **user-stories.md**. These tests were carried out both by myself and a number of external users not involved in the development of the app.

The test scripts for these manual user tests can be found in the PDF titled **test-scripts.pdf**.
