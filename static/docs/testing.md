# Testing

Details of testing for the **Binge | Watch** app built as part of the **Data Centric Development Milestone Project** can be found below.

## Validation

**W3C Markup Validation** was used to validate HTML.

**W3C CSS Validation** was used to validate CSS.

**JSHint** was used to validate jQuery.

**Python extension for Visual Studio Code** was used to validate Python.

## Manual Testing

I also created a series of user tests based on the **User Stories** found in [user-stories.md](https://github.com/TwelvePercentHero/bingewatch/blob/master/static/docs/user-stories.md). These tests were carried out both by myself and a number of external users not involved in the development of the app.

The test scripts for these manual user tests can be found in the PDF titled [test-scripts.pdf](https://github.com/TwelvePercentHero/bingewatch/blob/master/static/docs/test-scripts.pdf).
